1.The server sends a SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment) packet in response to SYN packets.
2.The attacker send large number of SYN packets, with spoofed source IP addresses(mostly). 
The server responds to each SYN with a SYN-ACK and allocates memory for that connection, waiting for the final ACK.
Because the attacker never complete the handshake, the ACK is never sent.
These incomplete connections remain in a half-open state, consuming server resources (memory, CPU). 
As attack continues, the server’s resources fills up.
Once the resources are full, the server cannot accept any new connections.
3.Rate limiting is one of the defense technique used against SYN Floods, it restricts the no. of incoming SYN packets coming from a single IP address.
